# Changelog for the pump

* **2015-01-20** Code frame and to do list
* **2015-01-21** argparse for command line, read tab-delimited text file from args, first output tab delimited file 
from VIVO
* **2015-01-22** get is complete
* **2015-01-27** General data structure for updates and updates.  Now handles datatype and lang.  Handles updates 
and adds. Handles all six value conditions.
* **2015-01-29** Enumerations handled.  Filters handled.
* **2015-01-30** 0.29 Data structure enhanced to indicate multi-valued predicates. 0.30 Handles multi-valued 
predicates. Added include parameter to add predicate values to source.  Useful to short hand inference paths
* **2015-01-31** 0.31 Data structure enhanced to record type of intermediate object in paths.  Added recursive 
scaffolding for paths.  Added photo test case to extension.txt. 0.32 Use rdflib to generate triples 
from fuseki. Remove temp file processing for loading og graph -- load directly.  Refactor get_triples removing local 
functions to create serialized triples -- use rdflib instead. Remove "org" and "organization" references from the code.  
Everything will be generalized.
* **2015-02-02** 0.33 update_def contains entity and column defs.  update_def is global.  Graph query generated from 
update_def -- local org references removed. Begin work on generating query for spreadsheet.  do_get output uses 
update_def, no hard coded column names.  do_get now uses a machine generated query.
* **2015-02-03** 0.34 general enumeration handling for get and update.  enum values in UPDATE_DEF are used to find 
files with enum tables.  The tables are loaded and used by do_get and do_update.  No hard coding remains.
* **2015-02-04** 0.35 Refactor do_get to simplify processing.  Values are now sets, either single or multi-valued. 
Begin work on multi-path update.  Two step path is working.  More testing required.  ENUM as global name.
* **2015-02-05** 0.36 Read and write the update definition as a JSON file.  Add pylint config to the project.  Address 
pylint messages. Add lint.txt report.  Add json file for update definition to the project.  Add vivofoundation to the 
project.  Eventually we will trim down vivofoundation to include only functions useful to the "pump".  Start calling 
this thing the VIVO data pump.  New files:
    * .pylintrc -- a pylint config for this project
    * lint.txt -- pylint output for sv_orgs.py
    * update_def.json -- the JSON representation of the update definitions
    * update_def_frag.py -- Python code for the JSON definitions. _DEPRECATED_
    * vivofoundation.py -- Support code for the pump.  Will be renamed.
* **2015-02-06** 0.37 Minor code improvements to address pylint and pyCharm suggestions
* **2015-02-06** 0.38 WORK IN PROGRESS.  New vivopump library.  New calls.  Updating code.  0.38 is not operational.
* **2015-02-06** 0.39 pyunit tests for each function in vivopump.  Tests pass.  More tests can/should be added.  
sv_orgs operational.  get and update tested.  Code now refers to vivopump for helper functions and uses new vivopump 
function names. prepare_column_values split out from do_get.  Added label and type triples for intermediate objects
* **2015-02-07** 0.40 Refactor main code for clean pylint and clean pycharm.  Two step path testing looks good
* **2015-02-08** 0.41 Draft grant_def.json for grant management in VIVO.  Requires three new enums (deptid, sponsorid, 
ufid), and five new filters (datetime, title, dollar_amount, deptid, sponsor_award_id).  Added improve_title, 
improve_dollar_amount, and comma_space to vivopump.  Test cases for each added to test_vivopump
* **2015-02-09** Date, deptid and sponsor award id filters added to vivopump.py.  Tests added to test_vivopump.py.  All 
enumerations added.
* **2015-02-10** Improve formatting of get query. Improve comments. Update for buildings as test case.
* **2015-02-11** 0.42 Improve make_get_query to avoid nested optionals.  Handle value in VIVO not in enumeration table. 
Improve def files.  Now have person, section, pub, grant and building.  All run in Jena, but not all run in Fuseki.
* **2015-02-14** 0.43 -v option for verbose output.  Move write_update_def to vivopump.  Add test case.
* **2015-02-15** 0.44 Using sparqlwrapper in new vivo_query.  Using stardog SPARQL endpoint.  Add pystardog to repo.  
Add try_sparqlwrapper to repo.
* **2015-02-16** 0.45 Warn regarding multiple values in VIVO for single valued predicate paths
* **2015-02-17** 0.46 Named pump.py.  Default files are pump_def.json and pump_data.txt.  Improved help. Unicode bug 
fixed in update.  Enum not found fixed in update.  Fixed bug in do_get regarding tabs in fields.
* **2015-02-18** Course_def.json and course_data.txt.  Can all the linkages be created by the pump? Begin framing the 
Pump class. Begin framing the unit tests for add, change and delete elements.  Restructure files and folders for unit 
tests and data.  See wiki for test cases.
* **2015-02-19** 0.47 Pump() is now a class in its own file pump.py.  sv (Simple Vivo) is a main program that runs the 
pump. Pump Serialize test case.
* **2015-02-20** Added test case descriptions for simple vivo as wiki page to the pump repo for command line testing
* **2015-02-21** Minor code formatting and comment improvements
* **2015-02-24** 0.48 Clean up the repo.  Removing unused files. Rewrote 2 of 3 step 2 cases, warnings that third are 
not finished.  **UNTESTED**
* **2015-02-25** 0.49 Preparing test frames for unit tests of data cases. Improve comments. Refactor update() and 
do_update() to support injection of data via JSON rather than file -- used for test cases. Lots of progress with 
refactored code, tracking down bugs and writing test cases for update().  do_update() now returns the add and sub 
graphs.  These are now tested directly in the test cases for appropriate triples in each test case.  First three 
data use case tests (see wiki) complete.
* **2015-02-26** 0.50 Two additional test cases coded and passed -- Add for unique two step path.  A test case for 
creating the path, and another for adding an attribute to an existing intermediate entity.  Refactor get_graph to use 
new make_update_query().
* **2015-02-27** 0.51 New make_update_query for path length 1 and path length 2 working as expected. Refactored 
get_graph to handle path length 2 and 3
* **2015-02-28** 0.52 make_update_query for path length 3.  Removed use of global variables UPDATE_DEF and ENUM.  No 
more globals! Begin moving support functions to the vivopump module.  make_update_query moved. Remove duplicated to dos
* **2015-03-01** 0.53 Move read_update_def, make_rdf_term, get_graph to vivopump.  Add test cases for each.  Fixed bug 
in make_update_query resulting from implicit casting of URIRef to string. Refactor make_update_query and get_graph to 
make slices of the graph and combine them, one slice per path in the update_def.  Much faster. Clean up test files.  
do_update() refactored to push two_step_update to its own function.  Additional two step test cases.  Test two step 
test cases pass.
* **2015-03-02** 0.54 Refactor update() to remove unused columns defs from the update def prior to get_graph.  
get_graph() runs in liner time based on number of columns.  Reducing the number of columns to the columns that are in 
common between update_def and update_data significantly speeds up the get_graph() and supports writing "large" 
update_defs.  Fixed bug in get_graph() -- now includes all entities as specified in the entity sparql.  _FIRST_ path 
length three test passed!
* **2015-03-03** Improved testing of path 3 partial path
* **2015-03-04** test_sv.py started for testing Simple VIVO command line scenarios
* **2015-03-05** Improve person_def.json to include research areas.  Add people_types.txt as a enum for types.  
faculty.txt is a spreadsheet of faculty resulting from an sv get
* **2015-03-06** Code formatting and to do improvements
* **2015-03-07** 0.55 Three new test cases for unique three length paths.  Add, Change, Delete working on three length 
unique paths.
* **2015-03-11** Four new test cases for multi-value one length path.  Add, change, change/no-op, Delete are working 
on multi-valued length one paths.
* **2015-03-15** 0.56 Can inject original graph to the pump.  Useful for testing.  Added test case using injected 
original graph
* **2015-03-21** 0.57 Enum values in update_def are now full path names to find filenames anywhere.  Root filenames 
become the names of the enums in the structures.
* **2015-03-25** Improved directory structure.  Examples folder now has subfolders for each domain -- buildings, 
faculty, orgs, etc
* **2015-03-30** 0.58 Remove feature added.  A column named "remove" may appear in the update spreadsheet.  If the 
value in the remove column is "True" or "true", then the pump will remove all triples related to the uri as either 
subject or object. To do now relate only to the software. Test case to dos are in test_vivopump.py.  Test cases added 
to test_vivopump.py.  *UNTESTED* Enhancement of examples are now issues in the GitHub repo -- if creating or working 
or testing these new examples results in desired software changes, these will be entered as appropriate to dos in the 
appropriate software file.
* **2015-04-01** Remove works as designed.  Perhaps not as expected.  It removes triples available to the update.  We 
might have thought it removed all triples associated with entity.
* **2015-04-06** 0.59 Add no filters option to command line in sv.  get -nf shows VIVO data "as is".  get shows data 
with filters as defined in update_def. do_get now works with our without filters.  Without filters you can see what 
VIVO has.  With filters you can get a spreadsheet ready for update.  Filters done before enumerations, so an improved 
value may be enumerated.  Filtering removed from update. File minimal.txt removed.  New test class for testing get 
scenarios.  Two new test cases for get -- with and without filters.  Added support for lang parameters.  If a literal 
has a lang attribute in the update_def, it will be used to add triples. Support for dataype has also been added, but 
additional work is needed.  So consider this *UNTESTED*
* **2015-04-07** 0.60 read_update_def recursion simplified.  cast_to_rdflib added to read_update_def to support rdflib 
datatypes.  data type test cases pass.  Order of columns in def file is now preserved in the update_def.  New test case 
for update_def order checking passes.  Order now used in get.
* **2015-04-09** Planned feature removed from the plan.  Had thought that the pump would support look-up by keys other 
than URI.  Now see no reason for this additional complexity.  When an update is performed with no URI, a URI is creat
and the row is added.  When get is run, URIs are fetched.  All is good.
* **2015-04-12** vivopump.py now supports use of the VIVO API for sparql query.
* **2015-04-18** 0.61 Null values in source data removed prior to update.  Fixed bug in enum filename.  uf_examples 
remove_current working as expected.  Work in progress on add_current
* **2015-04-19** Start work on ConfigParser for sv.py.  All options specified.  Too easy.
* **2015-04-22** Begin work on person ingest.  Too hard.  Without position_data.csv
* **2015-04-29** Work on make_person_update_data in uf_examples.

* **2015-05-06** write_csv added to vivopump.  Test case added to test_vivopump.
* **2015-05-07** Now making UF Person Data from source
* **2015-05-08** Change approach in uf_examples to a chain of filters to get from uf source data to a pump update file
* **2015-05-09** Add all shelve files to uf_examples/person. Add read_csv_fp and write_csv_fp, and test cases, for 
reading and writing csv files from a file pointers rather than a filename.  Supports reading and writing from stdin 
and stdout. ufid_exception_filter added to uf_examples/person -- removes ufid on an exception list from the data to 
be processed by the pump. privacy_filter added to uf_examples/person.  Removes people from processing if they have 
privacy flags and/or can not be found in the UF privacy data.  That is, they must be found and must have privacy flags 
that allow them to be in VIVO.  Add get_vivo_ufid to vivopump.py and a test case to test_vivopump.  The function 
queries vivo and returns a dictionary keyed by ufid where items are uri.  merge_filter has been added to 
uf_examples/person.  The merge_filter combines data from UF with data already in VIVO to ensure updates of data already 
in VIVO as well as the addition of new people from source.
* **2015-05-10** merge_filter adds uri and current columns only.  No extraneous columns.  manage_columns_filter.py to 
add and remove columns added to uf_examples/person.  ufid_exception_filter now marks people as remove.  This will apply
not only to people in the source, but people in VIVO if the merge filter is run first.  contact_filter.py added to 
uf_examples/person to add contact data to the pump input file. uri_exception_filter.py added to uf_examples/person. Add
salary_plan_filter to uf_examples/person
* **2015-05-11** Add homedept_assignment_filter.py to uf_examples/person to handle privacy issues resulting from people
having home departments in restricted in departments.  update the manage_columns_filter to remove vars related to
positions.
* **2015-05-12** person_update_data.txt added to uf_examples/person. Clean-up unused files from uf_examples/person. 
Start work on uf_examples/person/person_def.json
* **2015-05-13** Start work on uf_examples/positions.  Three filters.
* **2015-05-14** merge_filter added to uf_examples/positions.
* **2015-05-15** Remove the current_people example from uf_examples.  This is now handled by uf_examples/person.
* **2015-05-16** Add improve_jobcode_description to vivopump.py and three test cases to test_vivopump.py.  Add 
position_exception_filter.py to uf_examples/positions to handle positions that do not qualify for VIVO.

unique_ccn_filter, merge_filter.  One new vivopump function get_vivo_ccn for finding courses by common course number 
(UF primary key).  One new text improvement function -- improve_course_title for improving abbreviations in course 
titles.  New test cases for improve_course_title.  Course data, course_def.json, README added to uf_examples/courses.  
Filters work as expected.  Ready for upload test to VIVO.
* **2015-05-26** sv 0.4 all command line parameters are keyword.  No positional parameters.
* **2015-05-27** sv 0.5 Reconcile config and command line.  Set defaults via dict.
* **2015-05-28** sv 0.6 All arguments are now defaulted in the software, can be supplied via the cofig, which
overwrites software defaults, and finally on the command line which overwrites both.  Each argument can be set in
any of these three ways.  Six arguments are currently implemented.  Six arguments to be implemented.
* **2015-05-29** args inter and intra are fed through the pump to get and update to read_csv and do_get
* **2015-05-30** Removed old_vivo_query from vivopump.py.  Replaced use of global variables with passed parameters.

* **2015-06-02** Investigating minor surgery needed to add a type assertion to the get query to isolate types of phone
numbers and create a unique path to value
* **2015-06-06** Support "qualifier", a new attribute in step definitions.  In some situations the path from the entity 
to the value may not be uniquely defined through a predicate path unless additional qualification is provided.
qualifiers are SPARQL statements which can be inserted to qualify any "object" in a path.  See 
uf_examples/orgs/org_def.json
* **2015-06-08** Repair calling sequences for do_two and do_three step updates. Remove extraneous prints.
* **2015-06-09** Minor update to org_def for testing.  Will need to use qualifiers in update to identify specific URI
* **2015-06-10** get_step_triples() used in update to get the triples corresponding to the current step.
* **2015-06-11** Some preliminary code in get_step_triples for qualifiers.  WIll need more triples in the update graph
to process qualifiers -- the update graph currently does not contain the triples needed to make the step queries.

* **2015-09-05** Minor code formatting.  Move arg processing from sv.py to get_args.  Use get_args in filters.
PumpEnumTestCase repaired.  Improve copyright notices.  All filters now use get_parms.  Require bibtexparser.
prefix is now a query param.  vivo_query expects a prefix in the query parms.  All sv.cfg updated to include
prefix.  Unit tests not yet updated.  read_update_def improved -- now throws error if name in object matches name
in column_def.  Unit test added. Start work to support order_by.
* **2015-09-06** Adopt semantic versioning.  See http://semver.org. Pump version set at 0.6.1.  README.md explains
semantic versioning and documents the API for the Pump.
* **2015-09-07** 0.6.2 Dates example.  Pump calling sequence changes.  Support tab as a value in the config file.
Significant [wiki documentation](https://github.com/mconlon17/vivo-pump/wiki).

Pump values. Code moved from pup to vivopump.  Eventually pump will be methods only.  No helper or auxiliary code.
test_vivopump.py updated to remove query_parms.  Encapsulate code in sv.py in a main() function and check for 
\_\_name\_\_=="__main__" to run the main() function.
* **2015-09-10** 0.6.4  Order of column_defs in the update_def is now respected in the output generated by get. Begin
Education example.  PathLengthException added to vivopump.py.  Test case added. Education example now supports 
qualifier on length 1 path.
* **2015-09-11** 0.6.5 Strict enumeration for update.  When update value is not found in enumeration, an ERROR message
is generated and the column value is set to blank (no update). Remove print from add_order. Improve education example.
Improve strip() for included values.  PumpRemoveTestCase now uses injected graphs -- we load the graph with specific
triples and update uses the test graph rather than querying VIVO.  This tests update() explicitly without reliance
on VIVO URLs.
* **2015-09-12** 0.6.6 Improve education example.  Remove print/verbose from PumpRemoveTestCase. Qualifiers now working
for path length 1 case. Test case demonstrates sorting a CSV structure.  do_remove refactored as __do_remove, a
private method of the Pump class.  do_get refactored as __do_get, a private method of the Pump class. 
do_three_step_update refactored as __do_three_step_update, a private method of the Pump class.  do_two_step_update
refactored as __do_step_update, a private method of the Pump Class.  do_the_update refactored as __do_the_update, a 
private method of the Pump class.  pump.py now has only a class definition, methods and private methods. multiple_one
test cases updated to use graph injection and remove VIVO dependency.
* **2015-09-13** Remove redundant PathLengthException from pump.py.  testgraph.py defines TestGraph() a Graph() with
known triples for testing the Pump.  Ten tests updated to use TestGraph.
* **2015-09-14** Add Awards and Honors example.  Combine cities and buildings examples into one folder called locations.
Will create a generic locations def that supports types, lat long and within for managing location.  Rename
examples/faculty to examples/people. Retire examples/sections. Add examples/concepts placeholder folder. Add 
examples/services placeholder folder.  Add examples/mentoring placeholder folder.  Add examples/journals placeholder
folder.  Add examples/positions as placeholder folder. Wiki, diagram and folders now aligned.
* **2015-09-15**  0.6.7.  Pump defaults for defn and src changed to current directory. TestNewURI test cases 
repaired.  Repaired UpdateQueryTestCase.  Repaired GetGraphTestCase.  Repaired
WriteCSVTestCase.  Repaired VIVOQueryTestCase. Repair PumpRemoveTestCase.  Repaired PumpGetTestCase.  Repaired 
VIVOGetTypesTestCase.  Repaired VIVOGetUFIDTestCase.  Repaired VIVOGetAuthorsTestCase.  
Repaired VIVOGetSponsorsTestCase. Repaired PumpTestCase. Repaired PumpUpdateCallTestCase.  
Repaired PumpUpdateLiteralsTestCase.  Now working as expected.
* **2015-09-16** Begin examples/locations. Location enumeration supports unicode.  order_by no longer required in 
make_get_query. Remove uri print from do_get. Update examples/locations buildings and cities examples.
* **2015-09-17** Add examples/concepts.
* **2015-09-18** Move create_enum to vivopump.py.  Update make_enum in examples.  Test case added for create_enum.
Length two tests rewritten for 1.6 and TestGraph.
* **2015-09-19** 0.6.8 order_by implemented in do_get. make_rdf_term_from_source added to vivopump. 
MakeRdfTermFromSourceTestCase added with five cases.  prepare_columns refactored to return rdflib terms.  
__do_the_update refactored to used rdflib terms.  Simplifies code, handles all rdflib term types and compares.  All
test cases pass.  Removing VIVO date dependencies from PumpUpdateDataTestCases.  Two cases to improve.
* **2015-09-20** Begin examples/grants
* **2015-09-21** More work on examples/grants. Complete the grant example.  Repair bug in write_csv regarding one-line
spreadsheets.  Complete examples/journals with sample journal data provided.
* **2015-09-22** Complete examples/courses.  Includes course management and teaching assignment management.
* **2015-09-23** 0.7.0 Support for prefixes in def files (Finally\!).  test_substitution added to 
ReadUpdateDefTestCase.  `examples/orgs` is complete
* **2015-09-24** 0.7.1. get now warns when values can not be found in enumerations, and supplies a blank
value in the returned spreadsheet. Improving `testgraph.py` and PumpUpdateDataTestCase.  All tests in the 
case now pass.
* **2015-09-25** Begin mentoring example.  All cfg updated for 1.6 ontology prefixes.  All json updated to use
prefixes.  Person example complete.
* **2015-09-26** 0.7.2 support for closures.  New test case for reading defs with empty columns -- useful for 
adding empty columns to get results -- columns such as notes or remove.  Begin work on closures -- additional 
column defs that provide alternate paths to entities.  New ClosureTestCase closures.  Executing the closures 
allow us to reuse the columns and create "triangular" assertions -- assertions between entities created earlier 
in an update.  Example:  A leads to B and A leads to  C.  Closures allow us to make assertions between B and C 
by creating paths from A to B to C (or A to C to B). Closure processing added to __do_update. Closure testing
continues.
* **2015-09-27** Closure documentation in the wiki. improve examples/people/person_types.txt
* **2015-09-28** Remove use of UF ontology extensions and UF domain addresses from test cases.  Now all test
cases use vivo.school.edu as the domain name.  Closures working.  No code changes -- just getting the test
case and def file writen properly. See `test_normal_closure`.  Closure example added to description of 
closures in the wiki pages.  Update connection strings and prefix for `uf_examples/orgs`
* **2015-09-30** Progress on `examples/pubs`
* **2015-10-01** Design work on set element column.  Issue #44
* **2015-10-02** Ready for merge enhancement.
* **2015-10-03** 0.8.0 Add support for boolean columns.  Add BooleanColumnTestCase to test_vivopump.py.  Add test
case test_novalue to ReadUpdateDefTestCase.  Add validation test to `validate_update_def`
* **2015-10-04** Remove the data directory.  This is no longer used.  data for test cases is found as a sub
directory of the tests directory.
* **2015-10-05** examples/grants updated with closures for investigator and added AdminRole for department.  
examples/teaching updated to provide closure for instructor and course.  examples/education updated to provide
EducationalProcess and closures.  All need testing.
* **2015-10-06** Experimenting with Gitbook.  And reversing Gitbook.  Gitbook will be done in its own repository.
* **2015-10-15** Starting uf_examples/orcid.  Add improve_org_name, Improvements to uf_examples/sponsors -- 
use boolean column for funder, use improve_org_name
* **2015-10-17** 0.8.1 Test for reserved words when reading definitions.  Add test case `test_reserved_word`.  Tests 
pass. Improve comments in `make_get_data`. Add types to `tests/data/people_types.txt`.  get now returns binary columns.
Test case `test_boolean_get` added.  Add addition persons to TestGraph for merge testing.  Add `PumpMergeTestCase`.
