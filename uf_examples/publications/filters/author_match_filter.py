"""
author_match_filter.py -- find the authors in VIVO, and match them to authors
    in the source.  This is often called disambiguation.

There are two inputs:
    - authors in VIVO keyed by name parts.
    - authors in the source keyed by name parts.

There are two cases:

1.  The source indicates the author is not a UF author.  In this case, the
    author will automatically be added as a "stub."
    No attempt is made to match stubs.  This leads to proliferation of stubs
    but is consistent with "Assert what you know" and avoids assuming two stubs
    are the same.
2.  The source indicates the author is at UF.  In this case, extensive
    disambiguation matching occurs, based on name and name parts.  If no match
    occurs, the author will be added as a UFEntity.  If multiple matches occur,
    one is selected at random and a disambiguation report entry is produced
    showing all the possible matches and the one that was selected.  Many
    disambiguation cases involve two URI.  Randomly selecting one cuts the
    effort to assign these potentially by half.  If exactly one match occurs,
    the match is made, the URI provided in the update data.
